 🔴Linear Search
What it is:
Linear Search checks each element one by one from the start until the target is found.
How it works:
Compare the target with every item in the list.
Time Complexity:
Best case: O(1) (found at first position)
Worst case: O(n) (found at last or not found)
When to use:
When the list is unsorted or very small.

  🔴Binary Search
What it is:
Binary Search repeatedly divides the list into two halves to find the target.
Important:
The list must be sorted.
How it works:
Check the middle →
If target is smaller → search left half
If larger → search right half
Time Complexity:
Best case: O(1)
Worst case: O(log n)
When to use:
When the list is sorted and large.
